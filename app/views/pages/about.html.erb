<h2>About me:</h2>

<p>My name is Dean Palm, and I am looking for an internship or entry level position in web development. I am an eager, highly motivated, fast learner seeking to grow my professional skills in the tech industry.</p>

<p>I completed the <a href="http://themakersquare.com">MakerSquare</a> web development program and have been teaching myself over the last year. I am interested in creating web applications with rich front end user experiences that lend themselves to more overall utilities.</p>

<p>I stand out for having excellent communication skills both written and verbal.</p>

<p>And most of all for my curiosity in everything tech.</p>
